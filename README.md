Asking Questions - Endpoint
CODE: THis program takes in a user's name and time they woke up and concatenate's those inputs into a sentence
Peer review by :Kent TT. Great job the program works like its supposed to , there was no error at all.

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in questions/ *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in your name followed by a slash.
Then type in the time you woke up.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/questions/{name}/{time}
